## 🚀 Project Overview  

Flight fare prediction is a classical time-series problem that identifies trends in past observations to forecast future prices. Popular tools like Google Flights provide insights into:  
- **Fare status**: Whether fares are high, low, or average.  
- **Past and future fare trends.**  
- **Ideal booking times for flights.**  

This app predicts flight prices based on:  
- Departure and arrival dates.  
- Source and destination cities.  
- Stoppages.  
- Airline carriers.

## 🎯 Features  

- **Fare Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.  
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of price trends for better decision-making.  
- **User-friendly Interface**: Flask-powered application for a seamless user experience.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy assessed through metrics like MAE, MSE, and R².
